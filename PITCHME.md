## This is good news, but
- Who? |
- How? |

---
## The obvious "who"s
- Statoil's Digital Center of Excellence |
- Software Development teams |
- Research & Development in Statoil |
- Cooperation with academia and research institutes |
- Cooperation with commercial partners |

---

## Question: What is missing?

---

## The 15922 remaining employees!
- Everyone will be needed
---

Digitalization is a strategy, not a thing you can buy

---
## Example:
- Maintenance of equipment |
- Limited lifetime |
- Premature failures |
- Extended lifetime |

---
### Based on the goals, the path to success will vary!

Note:
The "who"s and the hows - depends.

Note:
- Example: Enable experts to keep an eye on important indicators 
- Agree on common data models, master data, make data available through data storage platforms, start using visualization tools.

Less planning, more doing, fail, and iterate. Need to steal from Agile software development, Lean startups etc. Your product is never done, it continously lives, and then it dies.

Note:
- Example: Calculate remaining useful life 
- Could be easy, could be difficult, could be impossible.

We must think scientifically. Could deploy a "data science" team, or the R&D organization.

Note:
- Example: Automatically order parts and schedule maintenance based on condition 
- Depends on a lot of other IT systems, vendors, etc. Will the cost of implementing it be worth the gain we get?

**(New and unchartered) collaborative constellations is the only way to succeed.**
</br></br>
*The mainstream line cannot do this on their own*
</br></br>
*BUT NOR CAN THE SPECIALISTS* |
