### Based on the goals, the path to success will vary!

### Based on the goals, the path to success will vary!

- Goal 1: Enable experts to keep an eye on important indicators 
 - Agree on common data models, master data, make data available through data storage platforms, start using visualization tools.
---
- Goal 2: Calculate remaining useful life 
 - Could be easy, could be difficult, could be impossible. Simple "data science" task, or a separate R&D project |
---
- Goal 3: Automatically order parts and schedule maintenance based on condition 
 - Depends on a lot of other IT systems, vendors, etc. Will the cost of implementing it be worth the gain we get? |

Digitalization is a strategy, not a thing you can buy
---
(New and unchartered) collaborative constellations is the only way to succeed.
